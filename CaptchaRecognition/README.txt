Refined the CaptchaRecognition so it can run smoothly on the environment of TensorFlow 1.5.0 Based on the Windows CMD.

With command 'python xxx.py'. It can work.

The running python file order is :
	1. captcha_records.py
	2. captcha_train.py 
	3. captcha_eval.py
	4. captcha_recognize.py 

Note that before training, you should set the parameter of your training sample in the 'config.py'.	
	
The code is cloned not wrote by myself. 

I hope I can implement TF into practice sooner.
